# Claim Bug

Unfortunately, at the moment we do not have a platform 100% dedicated to tracking bugs. However, we have our Github, and the "issues" tab, where you can submit your bugs, follow the title rule below for classifying bugs:

bugpoint(short description): Submit a fully and detailed description about the bug.
Ex:

```llvm(compiler): LLVM is not the correct version for compilation```

***

# Set-Up your Dev Environment.

See the README on our GitHub home page (https://github.com/galaxy-lang/galaxy?tab=readme-ov-file#build-the-projec) to install 
your project on your machine.

If you got stuck in any process, contact us: <>

# Write the patch and send to review code.

After writing the patch, open a Pull Request in our Github the code will be reviwed and 

possibly will be accepted :)
